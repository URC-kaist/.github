# URC-KAIST (MR² KAIST Rover Team)

**KAIST’s Autonomous Mars Rover Team – University Rover Challenge Division**

## 🛰️ About Us

**URC-KAIST** (MR² KAIST Rover Team) is a student-led robotics team at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) focused on developing autonomous rovers for the **University Rover Challenge (URC)** – the world’s premier collegiate Mars rover competition.

Our mission is to push the boundaries of autonomous robotics through hands-on research and development while fostering educational growth and interdisciplinary collaboration. We design Mars rover prototypes capable of navigating rough terrain, performing manipulation tasks, and executing autonomous science missions in simulated Martian environments.
